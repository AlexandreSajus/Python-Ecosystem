# Python-Ecosystem
A simple discrete ecosystem model in Python illustrating prey-predator systems and natural selection

The ecosystem shows the interaction between foxes and bunnies. It takes into account hunger, age, reproduction, vision range and fear

Parameters can vary to simulate natural selection
